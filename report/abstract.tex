This report describes an approach to the problem of polytope
packing into a parallelepiped by means of an encoding into
an SMT-Solver. The encoding is simple and flexible, and it
can easily handle both convex and non-convex polytopes. 
A simple experiment with an unoptimized prototype shows 
that this technique may outperform heuristic-based approaches
in finding the minimal height of the packing.
