This report describes a method for solving the problem of polytope
packing into a parallelepiped by means of an encoding into
SMT. The encoding is simple and flexible, and it
can easily handle both convex and non-convex polytopes. 
A simple experiment with a prototypcal implementation shows 
that this technique is competitive w.r.t. heuristic-based approaches
in finding the minimal height of a feasible packing.
