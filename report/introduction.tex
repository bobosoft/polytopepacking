\section{Introduction}
Polytope Packing is the problem of placing a given set of
polytopes into a parallelepiped of given length and width
with the goal of finding the minimal possible height that
avoids polytopes collision (polytopes may touch but they
cannot compenetrate). 

The problem has been studied for instance by 
Stoyan et. al in~\cite{sto03}. We take this paper as
a reference and comparison for this report. More related
work can be found in the aforementioned paper.

Our approach is a plain encoding into an SMT formula. SMT,
Satisfiability Modulo Theories, is an area of research
that combines efficient SAT-Solving and domain-specific
decision procedures to build efficient tools that could
reason about, for instance, arbitraty boolean combinations 
of linear arithmetic costraints. The encoding exploits
the notion of Minkowski sum to formally describes concepts
such as ``polytope intersection''.

Therefore, the approach can be summarized as follows: 
take a set of polytope descriptions, encode the problem
into SMT, execute an SMT-Solver to find a solution (if any
exists), read the solution and translate it back to
coordinates that describes the polytopes placement.
