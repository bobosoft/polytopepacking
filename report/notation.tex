\section{Notation}
Throghout this paper we assume that we are working in a three-dimensional
euclidian space. We shall use $P_1, P_2, \ldots$ to denote polytopes with
points in $\mathbb{R}^3$, and $\point{p_1}, \point{p_2}, \ldots$ to denote
points in $\mathbb{R}^3$, where in particular $\point{0} = (0, 0, 0)$.
For a $\point{p_i}$ we indicate its three components with $(p_{i_x}, p_{i_y}, p_{i_z})$.
