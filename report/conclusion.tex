\section{Conclusion}

We have presented a simple approach to solve the polytope
packing problem that relies on an encoding into an SMT
formula. The approach is flexible, straightforward, and
it can be easily extended to support more features: for
example, selected polytopes can be constrained to touch
or to stick to a particular position, by adding more
constraints to the problem. Fixed-radious rotations can 
also be considered as a further step. The availability
and the efficiency of SMT-Solvers are key factors for
making this approach feasible in practice.
